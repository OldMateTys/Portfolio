# Portfolio showcase - Tyson

This project is a showcase of all my current propjects, with an about and contact section for those interested. This was created with the intention of learning the Front-End development languages, in combination with ahnds-on experience of project ideation, implementation and completion. That is no to say that this website is complete and immune from change, but I am satisfied with it's current iteration, as my focus is not on the Front-End space.

The website was heavily inspired by Brittney Chiang's portfolio website, see here: https://brittanychiang.com/
